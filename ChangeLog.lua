v2.2 Latest version of autogist

v2.1 Updated to latest version of cmodule

v2.0 Split into separate libraries: "Library Base" consists of the
     modules that just about every project will import.

v1.0 Converted to use toadkick's cmodule for importing 
     and Briarfox's AutoGist for versionning.
     It needs toadkick's code from 
        https://gist.github.com/apendley/5411561
     tested with version 0.0.8
     To use without AutoGist, comment out the lines in setup.
